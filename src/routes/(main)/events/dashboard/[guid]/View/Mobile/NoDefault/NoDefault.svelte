<div>
	<h4>Click the blue 'Add' button <br />to create a 'default' block.</h4>

	<p>This is the fallback block for whenever you're not broadcasting another block.</p>

	<p>
		The value block for your default block will also be used to send your split of the Boosts to
		you. When you add other blocks to broadcast, if you set that blocks split to 95%, then the
		remaining 5% will be split amongst your 'default' block.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you're using this as a Podcaster to broadcast a live episode, add your live episode to your
		feed and click podcast above to add that episode as your default block.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you're using the Split Kit for a conference, live concert, or as a DJ, you can use the value
		block from your podcast (if you have one), or create a chapter value block. The chapter value
		block would handle how the splits to the default block are handled.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, if you were using this at a conference, 50% of the splits for this block could go
		to the conference organizer, and 50% goes to the operator broadcasting events with the Split
		Kit. Or a venue using the Split Kit to allow the audience to Boost the band, could take a 50%
		cut, with 25% to the sound engineer, and 25% to the Split Kit operator.
